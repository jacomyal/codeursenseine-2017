There're an incredible number of articles- interviews- podcasts- and meta-visualizations available to anyone interested in the job.

For many data viz practitioners the market is dismissive and ignorant (even hostile) but positivity is the constant byword of the community.

Go find Cool Visualization Package on the web. 3) Read how it depends on six different funky Java/Python/XYZ libraries- which can all be correctly and painlessly installed by a grand total of three people in the world. 4) Faced with the cost-benefit analysis of \"Becoming an expert in six different funky libraries\" vs \"Having a Cool Visualization\"- I always say Screw It and move on. Data Visualization People are notoriously naive about what it takes to install- learn- use- and maintain their tools and products. I love me a good graphic- but if the cost (in time and personal frustration) to make that graphic is too high- I'm gonna pass.",
